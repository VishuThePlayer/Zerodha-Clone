whats wrong?
ChatGPT said:
The issue is with your JSX return statement.
In React, when you return multiple sibling elements, they must be wrapped in a single parent element (like a <div>, <section>, or <>...</> fragment).

Right now you have:

return ( 
    <div>
        <img src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/landing.png" alt="Hero_Img" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>hello</h1>
    </div>
);
üëâ This is invalid because there are two sibling <div> elements directly inside return.

‚úÖ How to Fix
You need to wrap them in a single parent element:

function Hero() {
    return ( 
        <div>
            <div>
                <img src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/landing.png" alt="Hero_Img" />
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>hello</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
Or, if you don‚Äôt want an extra wrapper div, you can use a React Fragment:

function Hero() {
    return ( 
        <>
            <div>
                <img src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/landing.png" alt="Hero_Img" />
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>hello</h1>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
‚ö° In short: JSX must return exactly one root element.

Do you want me to also show you a cleaner version where you combine the <img> and <h1> inside the same container (like a proper hero section)?

}


export default Hero;

need button in center
ChatGPT said:
Got it üëç ‚Äî right now your button is inside a d-flex align-items-center row column, so it will only center vertically, not horizontally.

If you want the button centered below the heading + paragraph, you should keep it in the same flex-column container and use Bootstrap‚Äôs justify-content-center + align-items-center.

Here‚Äôs a fixed version:

import React from 'react';

function Hero() {
    return ( 
        <>
            <div className="mb-5">
                <img 
                    src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/landing.png" 
                    alt="Hero_Img" 
                />
            </div>

            <div className="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center text-center">
                <h1>Invest in everything</h1>
                <p>
                    Online platform to invest in stocks, derivatives, mutual funds, ETFs, 
                    bonds, and more.
                </p>
                <button className="btn btn-primary mt-3">
                    Sign up for free
                </button>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}

export default Hero;
üîë What Changed:
Used one flex-column container instead of splitting heading/paragraph and button.

Added justify-content-center align-items-center text-center ‚Üí centers content horizontally.

Moved <button> inside the same column, so it appears centered under the text.

Added Bootstrap‚Äôs .btn btn-primary mt-3 for better styling.

üëâ Do you want the whole hero section (image + text + button) centered vertically on the page too, like a full-page hero?

You said:
what to do for img
ChatGPT said:
Good question! üéØ Right now your <img> will just sit at its natural size and alignment.
If you want it to behave like a Hero image (centered, responsive, and not breaking layout), you should:

‚úÖ Options for the <img>:
Make it responsive & centered
Add Bootstrap classes:

<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/landing.png" 
  alt="Hero_Img" 
  className="img-fluid mx-auto d-block mb-4"
/>
img-fluid ‚Üí makes it scale with screen size.

mx-auto d-block ‚Üí centers it horizontally.

mb-4 ‚Üí adds spacing below it.

Control size with CSS (if it‚Äôs too big)

.hero-img {
  max-width: 600px; /* or any size you prefer */
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
And use it:

<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/landing.png" 
  alt="Hero_Img" 
  className="hero-img mx-auto d-block mb-4"
/>
Full-width banner style
If you want the image to span the whole width like a background hero:

<div className="text-center mb-5">
  <img 
    src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/landing.png" 
    alt="Hero_Img" 
    className="w-100"
  />
</div>
w-100 ‚Üí makes it full width.

üëâ So, it depends:

Do you want the image centered with text below (logo-like)?

Or do you want it as a full-width banner background with text/button over it?

Which style are you aiming for?

need all in left side only
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî right now your <div className="col"> is inside a Bootstrap grid column, which by default spreads across available width. If you want all text aligned to the left side only, you have a couple of options depending on how "left" you mean:

üîπ 1. Left-align text inside the column
Just add Bootstrap‚Äôs text-start (or inline CSS):

<div className="col text-start">
  <h2>Trust with confidence</h2>
  <h3>Customer-first always</h3>
  <p>
    That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments,
    making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
  </p>
  <h3>No spam or gimmicks</h3>
  <p>

    use at your pace, the way you like. Our philosophies.
  </p>
  <h3>The Zerodha universe</h3>

  </p>
  <h3>Do better with money</h3>
  <p>
    With initiatives like Nudge and Kill Switch, we don't just facilitate transactions, but 
    actively help you do better with your money.
  </p>
</div>
üîπ 2. Limit width & keep content on the left
If you don‚Äôt want text stretching across the full screen, wrap it inside a smaller column:

<div className="container">
  <div className="row">
    <div className="col-md-6 text-start">
      {/* your content here */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
This keeps everything on the left half of the page, while right side stays empty.

üîπ 3. Pin text flush to left edge (ignore Bootstrap grid)
If you want it hard left, full width:

<div className="text-start" style={{ maxWidth: "700px" }}>
  {/* your content */}
</div>
This removes grid behavior and just makes a text block aligned left with a max width.

üëâ Do you want it like Zerodha‚Äôs website (left column text + right column image),
or strictly all text hugging the left edge of the screen?

suppose i want some lione to start from next
ChatGPT said:
Ah I see what you mean üëç ‚Äî in JSX (and HTML), text inside a <p> or <h*> flows as one block. If you want a new line inside the same block, you have a few options:

‚úÖ Option 1: Use <br /> for line breaks
If you want a manual break inside the same paragraph:

<p className='fs-5 fw-light'>
  That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments,<br />
  making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
</p>
This keeps it one paragraph but starts the second part on the next line.

‚úÖ Option 2: Use multiple <p> tags
If the text really represents separate ideas, wrap them in separate <p> tags:

<p className='fs-5 fw-light'>
  That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments.
</p>
<p className='fs-5 fw-light'>
  Making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
</p>
This will add spacing (Bootstrap applies margins between <p>s by default).

‚úÖ Option 3: Use <span> + CSS for inline control
If you want finer control (e.g., second line indented):

<p className='fs-5 fw-light'>
  That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments,
  <span className="d-block">
    making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
  </span>
</p>
d-block ‚Üí makes the span behave like a new line without breaking out of the <p>.

üëâ Quick rule of thumb:

Use <br /> for soft line breaks.

Use new <p> tags when the text is conceptually a different paragraph.

Use <span className="d-block"> if you want a new line but still part of the same paragraph.

Do you want me to adjust all your long paragraphs (like in "Customer-first always") so the second sentence starts from the next line?

You said:
Uploaded image
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing the screenshot üôå

Looking at it, the reason their paragraphs sometimes start a new line (without creating a big gap) is because they‚Äôre using either <br /> tags or CSS block elements like <span class="d-block"> inside the same <p>.

For example, this part:

That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments,
making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
is actually one <p> tag, but they force the second sentence to begin from the next line.

‚úÖ How you can do the same
Option 1: With <br />
<p className='fs-5 fw-light'>
  That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments,<br />
  making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
</p>
Option 2: With <span className="d-block">
<p className='fs-5 fw-light'>
  That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments,
  <span className="d-block">
    making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
  </span>
</p>
d-block makes the span behave like a new line while staying in the same paragraph.

This matches exactly how Zerodha‚Äôs site does it (cleaner than <br /> in many cases).

üëâ Do you want me to rewrite all four sections (Customer-first, No spam, Zerodha universe, Do better) so the second sentence starts on a new line, exactly like the screenshot?

You said:
they seems to be in same lenghtiu from left and right idk 
ChatGPT said:
Ahh I get what you‚Äôre noticing üëå ‚Äî in the screenshot, the paragraph text looks neatly aligned on both the left and right edges, almost like a newspaper column.

That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre using text justification. By default, Bootstrap uses text-start (left aligned). To get the same effect, you can add:

<p className="fs-5 fw-light text-justify">
  ...
</p>
But ‚ö†Ô∏è Bootstrap 5 removed the built-in text-justify class. So you‚Äôll need to add your own CSS:

.text-justify {
  text-align: justify;
}
Then use it:

<p className="fs-5 fw-light text-justify">
  That's why 1.6+ crore customers trust Zerodha with ~ ‚Çπ6 lakh crores of equity investments,
  <span className="d-block">
    making us India‚Äôs largest broker; contributing to 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.
  </span>
</p>
‚úÖ Result:

Left side: perfectly aligned.

Right side: also aligned, so text looks like it‚Äôs in a clean block of equal width (same as the screenshot).

üëâ Do you want me to refactor your Awards component so all four paragraphs are justified and have that neat alignment?

You said:
no bro code full like the screenshot
ChatGPT said:
Got it üëç ‚Äî you want the whole Awards section to look exactly like the screenshot:

make small image
ChatGPT said:
Right now your <img> tags are rendering at their full SVG size. You can easily shrink them in 3 different ways:

‚úÖ Option 1: Add width / height inline
<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" 
  alt="" 
  width="40" 
  height="40"
/>
This forces the icon to be 40√ó40 px (adjust as needed).

‚úÖ Option 2: Use Bootstrap utility class
Bootstrap has sizing helpers like w-25, w-50, etc.

<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" 
  alt="" 
  className="w-25"
/>
That makes the image take up 25% of the parent container width.

‚úÖ Option 3: Make a custom class (best for consistency)
In your CSS:

.icon-sm {
  width: 32px;
  height: auto;
}
Then:

<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" 
  alt="" 
  className="icon-sm"
/>
üëâ If you want them to sit inline with the text (like a list with icons), you can wrap them in a flex row:

<div className="row">
  <div className="d-flex align-items-center mb-2">
    <img src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" alt="" width="32" className="me-2" />
    <p className="mb-0">Free account opening</p>
  </div>

  <div className="d-flex align-items-center">
    <img src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" alt="" width="32" className="me-2" />
    <p className="mb-0">Free equity delivery and direct mutual funds</p>
  </div>
</div>
This makes the icon small + vertically centered with text, just like Zerodha‚Äôs pricing page.

üëâ Do you want me to rewrite your whole row into a clean flexbox list with small icons like in the official site?

i want picture to be small a bit what to
ChatGPT said:
Got it üëç you just need to control the image width/height so it doesn‚Äôt render too big.
Easiest fix is to give your <img> a fixed size either with inline props, Bootstrap utility, or a CSS class.

üîπ Quickest way (inline)
<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" 
  alt="" 
  width="32"   // try 24, 32, 40 depending on how small you want
  height="32"
/>
üîπ With Bootstrap utilities
<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" 
  alt="" 
  className="me-2" 
  style={{ width: "32px", height: "32px" }}
/>
üîπ Reusable CSS class (cleanest if you‚Äôll use multiple icons)
.icon-sm {
  width: 32px;
  height: auto; /* keeps aspect ratio */
}
<img 
  src="https://zerodha.com/static/images/pricing-eq.svg" 
  alt="" 
  className="icon-sm me-2"
/>
‚úÖ Pick one of these, and your picture will be smaller.

üëâ Do you want the image inline with the text (like a bullet point icon before ‚ÄúFree account opening‚Äù), or stacked above it?

need same to same like this first code it on canva
ChatGPT said:
I‚Äôve put a ready-to-use React component in the canvas that matches the screenshot: left text block + three pricing items on the right (‚Çπ0, ‚Çπ0, ‚Çπ20) with neat spacing and subtle ‚Äúsparkle‚Äù accents.

If you want it switched to Bootstrap-only utilities or Tailwind, say the word and I‚Äôll refactor it.

You said:
but those 3 i need in row and also space
ChatGPT said:
I updated your layout so the three pricing items are displayed in a single row with space between them, centered neatly like the screenshot.

You said:
use only bootstrap , everything should be row, even the icon and text should be row
ChatGPT said:
I refactored the component to use only Bootstrap rows and columns ‚Äî now each price item (icon + text) sits in a row column layout, perfectly aligned and spaced.

You said:
for 20 use https://zerodha.com/static/images/other-trades.svg
and for 0 i9 have givcen already
ChatGPT said:
I updated the pricing items so the ‚Çπ0 items use pricing-eq.svg and the ‚Çπ20 item uses other-trades.svg as icons, displayed inline with the numbers and text.
